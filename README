Homework 3: Locality


Help on this assignment was recieced from several TAs (thanks!).

All required aspects of this assignment should have been correctly implemented.
The optional extra credit 270 degree rotation has also been implemented. No
other extra credit modifiers were implemented.

Our solution uses the following general architecture:
        1) ppmtrans modifies images represented by Pnm_ppm using the
           A2Methods_UArray2 and A2Methods_T aspects of a2methods.
        2) a2methods uses a2plain.c for unblocked two-dimensional arrays and
           a2blocked.c for blocked two-dimensional arrays.
        3) a2plain.c uses UArray2_T for its underlying 2D array structure while
           a2blocked.c uses UArray2b_T for a 2D array with blocks.
        4) UArray2_T uses UArray_T. UArray2b_T uses UArray2b_T for the overall
           structure of the array and UArray_T for the blocks.
